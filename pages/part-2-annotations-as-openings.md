# Part 2: Annotations as Openings

An essential element of this project’s assertion is the ability to note the occurrences of dualistic spaces which contribute meaning to Muriel Rukeyser’s “The Speed of Darkness.” When listened audibly, Rukeyser’s poem transforms from the aforementioned “group” or “series” to a single poem—a single poetic occurrence—which is mediated by a variety of spaces. These spaces, although, become unrecognizable as separating stanzas, catching of breath, or dramatic pausing. The group or series that is “The Speed of Darkness” becomes that which it is meant to be: one. Rukeyser’s poetic work takes shape in the aforementioned listening experience, as if it was meant to be read aloud to truly and accurately communicate its meaning. In this sense, what the listener derives (and creates) from these dualistic spaces depends on the recognition of separative gaps in language, which is done via annotation.

Speaking to the second set of annotations, specifically, an emphasis on the dualistic spaces allows for the user to listen according to the gaps in language, which transforms the listening experience. Characterizing these spaces as such promotes active engagement with the audio recording and included poem. This practice offers a completely different way to read Rukeyser’s work, and especially her book The Speed of Darkness. For example, work that has been conducted by Mitts, Gander, and Sarah Daw may all benefit from the annotation of Rukeyser’s poetry in audio form. When conducting analysis on poetry recordings that concern silence (Mitts 2015), “dual aspects of modern life” (Gander 288), or the “trans-corporeal landscape” of poetry” (Daw 218), scholars are able to enunciate their claims according to the AV material in question. This opportunity opens a variety of work that has yet to be done in a variety of fields across multiple disciplines.

Therefore, while this project utilizes annotations to denote embodied dualistic spaces that produce meaning in Muriel Rukeyser’s “The Speed of Darkness,” it is also an opening for future scholarly work. The work done here serves as a template for the recognition and signification of meaning in spaces void of traditional linguistic capabilities. And not only does this offer a re-evaluation of certain poetic capabilities but, also, how audio-visual material is able to configure new (interpretations of) meanings. In this entirely new sphere of scholarship, we may discover how associative information in the form of comments and explanations reveal promising avenues for inquiry.
