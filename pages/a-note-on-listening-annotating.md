 Required for this project is a note on how to interact with the audio and annotations which accompany the text. Following the introduction are the annotations of Muriel Rukeyser’s speech at Sir George Williams University, “Muriel Rukeyser at SGWU, 1969,” as provided by SpokenWeb’s collection of archived audio materials (SpokenWeb). This recording is best listened to with headphones or external speakers. The annotations should be read alongside the process of listening to encourage active participation with the recording. The listener need not “look” for the duality spaces that will be discussed; merely interacting with the material will suffice. The next set of annotations all focus on the spaces within “The Speed of Darkness,” specifically. This recording is best listened to with headphones or external speakers—a higher volume may be required. The annotations should be read alongside the process of listening with regard to the variety of spaces which encompass the recording.
