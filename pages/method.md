# Method

The .mp3 file of “Muriel Rukeyser at SGWU, 1969,” was uploaded to the digital library, “The Internet Archive,” for accessibility. This is because AudiAnnotate software requires a public destination for the audio recording. The audio itself, however, may be located in the SpokenWeb collection “Sir George Williams Poetry Series.” This location was not utilized as there is no downloadable option for the .mp3 file. 

To annotate the audio provided by SpokenWeb, “Muriel Rukeyser at SGWU, 1969,” the free and open-source digital audio editor, Audacity, was utilized. The audio was uploaded in .mp3 format into the software. The physical annotations were applied using the “label” tool. This involved listening to the audio, pausing the audio, and creating a labelled annotation. The labels were, then, exported in .txt format. That file was imported into the AudiAnnotate software to generate the annotation format utilized in this project. Note that there may be discrepancies in the timestamps. While Audacity allows the user to label digital audio recordings down to fractions of a second, there is room for human error.

The second set of annotations required a manual shortening of the “Muriel Rukeyser at SGWU, 1969” audio recording to only include the poem “The Speed of Darkness.” To do this, Audacity was used to cut the .mp3 file. After which I annotated the shortened audio recording according to what I identified as spaces between the “stanzas” in the text format of the poem.
